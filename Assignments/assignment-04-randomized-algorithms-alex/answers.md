**1 Quicksort probabilities**

- **1a.** What is the probability that Quicksort does $\Omega({n^2})$
  comparisons?  

  The probability that Quicksort performs $\Omega({n^2})$ comparisons is $(lnn)/n$

- **1b.** What is the probability that Quicksort does $10^c n \lg n$
comparisons, for a given $c>0$? What does this say about the
deviation of the actual work from the expected work for Quicksort?

    Let c' be the constant in the asymptotic runtime of Quicksort. Using Markovâ€™s inequality we get that this probability is at most 
    c'/10^c. This means that it is extremely unlikely that Quicksort deviates very far from the expected runtime.

**2 From "Maybe" to "Definitely"**

- **2a.** Give an algorithm to improve the guaranteed success probability and state its work.

  Run A K times, and then check for correct output. If all runs fail return that the program failed. 

- **2b.** Show how to convert $\mathcal{A}$ into an
  algorithm that always produces the correct result, but has an
  expected runtime that depends on $w(n)$ and a success probability
  $\epsilon$.

  We run A until is succeeds. If A terminates, it has succeeded. The expected runtime is O(t(n)/epsilon)

**3 Determinism versus Randomization in Quicksort**

- **3b.** Compare running times using `compare-qsort` between variants of
Quicksort and the provided implementation of selection sort (`ssort`).

- **3c.** Compare the fastest of your sorting implementations to the Python sorting function `sorted`, conducting the tests in 3b above.
